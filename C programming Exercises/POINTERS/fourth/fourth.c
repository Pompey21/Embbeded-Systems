// One of the possible uses of a pointer to a pointer is when dealing with multi-
// dimensional matrices so that you keep track of the dimensions by simply calling
// a pointer that points to another pointer that points to a matrix.
// Example of pointer-pointer-varible is best seen in 2D matrix example.
